# Fake News Detection Using NLP

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code for a binary classification project aimed at distinguishing fake news from real news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages two main datasets, namely "Fake.csv" and "True.csv," which serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the model.

## Contents

- **Fake.csv:** Dataset containing samples of fake news.
- **True.csv:** Dataset containing samples of real news.
- **Fake_news_detection.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The datasets were preprocessed to handle any inconsistencies and ensure uniformity.
   - Text data was cleaned and tokenized for further analysis.
   - Classes were assigned: 1 for real news and 0 for fake news.

2. **Model Training:**
   - The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets.
   - The model was trained using various algorithms, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Confusion matrices were computed for each algorithm to assess model performance.
   - Accuracy metrics were used to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in distinguishing between fake and real news.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open and run the Notebook on Colab environment:
